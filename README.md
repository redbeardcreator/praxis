Programming Praxis Solutions
============================

The [Programming Praxis](http://programmingpraxis.com/) website contains many, many programming
challenges. This repository contains my solutions to some of the problems. I will solve the
problems in multiple languages, focusing (for now) on PHP, probably with Python and JavaScript
thrown in from time to time.

I will be using test driven development on much of this, so there will be a test suite for each
challenge. Therefore, while each language will have it's own subdirectory, there will be a
`challenges` directory and a `tests` directory and whatever configuration is needed for the given
language.
